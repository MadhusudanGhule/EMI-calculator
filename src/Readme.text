1. **Title/Project Name:**
   - **EMI Calculator with Pie Chart**

2. **Introduction:**
   - The project is an EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator that helps users calculate their monthly loan repayment amount for a given loan amount, interest rate, and tenure. Additionally, it presents the calculated data in the form of a pie chart for better visualization.

3. **Features:**

   - **Input Fields:**
     - Users can enter the following details:
       - Total cost of assets (loan amount).
       - Interest rate (in percentage).
       - Processing fee (in percentage).
       - Down payment amount.
       - Loan tenure (in months).

   - **EMI Calculation:**
     - The application calculates the EMI based on the input provided using the standard EMI calculation formula.
     - It considers the loan amount, interest rate, processing fee, down payment, and tenure to determine the monthly EMI.

   - **Interactive Slider for Down Payment and EMI:**
     - The project includes sliders that users can interact with to adjust the down payment or EMI amount.
     - As users move the sliders, the EMI and down payment values are updated in real-time.

   - **Pie Chart Visualization:**
     - After calculating the EMI, the project displays the EMI amount as a portion of the total cost of assets in a pie chart.
     - The pie chart offers a visual representation of how the EMI relates to the total cost of the asset.

   - **Tenure Selection:**
     - Users can select the loan tenure from predefined options using buttons.
     - The selected tenure affects the EMI calculation, and the results are updated accordingly.

   - **Total Down Payment and Total EMI Display:**
     - The project displays the total down payment amount and the total EMI amount based on the selected tenure.
     - Users can see these values alongside the sliders and pie chart for reference.

   - **Responsive Design:**

4. **Technologies Used:**
   - The project is built using React for the frontend.
   - React state and hooks are utilized for managing user input and dynamic updates.
   - A charting library like Chart.js or D3.js is used to create the pie chart.

5. **Skills Demonstrated:**
   - React development, including state management and event handling.
   - Mathematical calculations for EMI and down payment.
   - Data visualization using charts.
   - User interface design and responsiveness.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The "EMI Calculator with Pie Chart" project demonstrates the ability to build a 
   practical financial tool with an intuitive user interface. It provides users with a 
   simple way to understand their loan repayment structure and visualize the impact of their
    EMI on the total cost of the asset. This project showcases frontend development skills and the 
    ability to work with data visualization libraries.
